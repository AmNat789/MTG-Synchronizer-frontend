Follow these steps to set up and run the project:  

1. **Configure Environment Variables**

2. **Start the Development Server**  
   Run the following command to launch the development server:  
   ```sh
   yarn dev
   ```  

3. **Ensure the Backend Server is Running**  
   Make sure the backend server is up and running before testing the application.  

Once everything is set up, open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser to see the application in action. ðŸš€
